# halloween-counter

Made this quick halloween counter for my FAVORITE time of year when I pass out candy for the neighborhood kids. 

I always like to keep track of how many kids we have so I can make sure I have enough candy for the following year. So far we run out EVERY year just in time. 

We have HUNDREDS of kids in our neighborhood and I hope to use this app this year to kepe track!
